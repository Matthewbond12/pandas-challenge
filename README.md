Pandas Challenge - Bootcamp Module #4

Introduction:

In this challenge, we were tasked with applying our learnings from previous pandas and jupyter classes to extract various data points and write a detailed analysis showcasing our findings. This challenge forced us to utlize groupby and other aggregation built-in functions to extract key data. We also were tasked with adding new columns to existing DataFrames and creating new DataFrames.

PyCity Schools:

District Summary
Taksed with extracting unique school lists, using the count function to return total students, using the built-in mean function to identify average math and reading scores and then calculating the passing rate for each and overall. I then creted a new DataFrame displaying those output values.

School Summary
I was able to extract most of the relevant data asked for up and until creating the School Summary. I'm aware I need to create a new DataFrame with those values, but was unable to proceed to completion.
